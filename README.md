# MyWeather
*Kotlin weather application made simple

This is a very simple Android Kotlin application that uses the Current Weather API by openweathermap.org to find the users location when opened and displays
the local date and time as well as:

* What the weather feels like
* The true temperature
* The low temperature
* The high temperature
* The wind speed
* The humidity percentage 
* The current air pressure (in PSI)
